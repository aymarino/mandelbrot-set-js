# Mandelbrot Set

* The [Mandelbrot Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is a fractal that produces fascinating patterns when plotted and colored. This is a simple script that draws an interactive Mandelbrot set on an HTML5 Canvas that zooms in on clicked areas.

### To Do
* Use arbitrary precision in coordinates and calculations so as to not limit the resolution at higher magnifications.
* Use approximation techniques to speed up the drawing process.
* Refine coloring scheme
